                <h3 style="margin-top: 1vw; margin-bottom: 3vw;"> - Player of the month - </h3>

                <div style="overflow: hidden;">
                    <img src="medias/images/potm.png" alt="Cale Makar" style="width: 30%; float: right; margin-left: 2vw; margin-bottom: 1vw;">
                    <p>Cale Makar has been nothing short of sensational this season, solidifying his reputation as one of the premier defensemen in the NHL. From the first puck drop to the closing weeks of the campaign, Makar has showcased a rare blend of speed, skill, and hockey intelligence that sets him apart from his peers.</p>
                    <p>Offensively, Makar continues to redefine what it means to be a modern defenseman. His ability to transition the puck from the defensive zone to the attack is second to none, often leaving opponents flat-footed as he navigates the ice with incredible precision. His vision and playmaking have resulted in an impressive number of assists, setting up teammates with tape-to-tape passes that lead to high-danger scoring opportunities. On the power play, his calm under pressure and accurate shot have made him a key piece, consistently finding ways to break through even the most structured penalty kills.</p>
                    <p>Defensively, Makar's impact is just as profound. While his offensive flair often grabs headlines, his defensive game is equally remarkable. He uses his skating ability not just to drive the play forward but also to recover quickly, break up plays, and shut down opposing rushes. His stick work is elite, often disrupting plays without taking penalties, and his ability to read the game ensures he's always in the right position. Despite not being the biggest player on the ice, his physicality has improved, and he doesn't shy away from battles along the boards or in front of the net.</p>
                    <p>Makar's consistency throughout the season has been another standout attribute. Whether it's a crucial game against a division rival or a back-to-back on the road, his effort level and impact rarely waver. His leadership qualities have also come to the forefront, with his calm demeanor and clutch performances serving as a rallying point for his team</p>
                    <p>In key moments, Makar has proven to be a game-changer. He has delivered highlight-reel goals in overtime, critical defensive stops in tight games, and a knack for rising to the occasion when his team needs him most. It's this ability to perform under pressure that has many analysts and fans alike calling him a generational talent. Statistically, Makar's numbers are as impressive as his on-ice performance. He has consistently ranked among the league leaders in points by a defenseman, showcasing his offensive dominance. But beyond the box score, advanced analytics highlight his extraordinary value, with metrics like Corsi and expected goals consistently painting him as one of the most impactful players in the league.</p>

                <p>This website is the result of the creativity and hard work of a group of 12th graders who came together for an exciting school project! Every feature, design, and detail you see here was carefully crafted by us, from brainstorming the initial concept to coding and polishing the final product. Our goal was not just to complete an assignment but to create something meaningful, innovative, and reflective of our skills and interests. Along the way, we explored new technologies, overcame challenges, and learned the value of teamwork and perseverance. Through this website, we aim to showcase our ideas, share what we’ve learned, and inspire others to embrace their creative potential. So, take a look around and see what a group of dedicated students can achieve when they combine passion with hard work!</p>
